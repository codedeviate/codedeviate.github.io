    Windows 286/386/3.0/3.1/95/98/NT/2000/XP/Vista/11
    <br>
    For those of you who are wondering, I left the world of Windows after Windows 7. I have since returned to Windows with Windows 11 since that was installed on my new laptop and since it has WSL I have no problem using it.
    <br>
    The oldest version of Windows that I have used is Windows 1.25 which was groundbreaking at the time. Now we just laugh at the fact that you could only run four different programs, and they each had an assigned quarter of the screen unless they were using the entire screen.

    Linux
    <br>
    I have used Linux since 2004. Mainly Debian based distributions like Ubuntu and Mint. I have also used Fedora, CentOS and Kali.
</p>

<p>
    Mac OS
    <br>
    I have used macOS since 2017. I have used Mac OS X from 10.13 (High Sierra).
    <br>
    The biggest reason for switch to macOS at work was that I didn't want to use Windows and there are few computers that support Linux out of the box. So macOS became a good alternative since it is based on BSD.
